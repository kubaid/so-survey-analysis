## Installation

The code was written in Python 3.10. All the necessary libraries are listed in the requirements.txt file and can be installed using the following command:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Project Motivation

In this project I was interested in analyzing time trends using Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey from years 2017 - 2022. Specifically, I was interested in the following questions:

1. Which programming languages were the most popular (most used)?
2. Which languages were the most loved, dreaded and wanted?
3. How did the average developer salary progressed compared to the official inflation readings in certain countries?

This project was made as part of the Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree.

## File Description

The repository consist of one Jupyter notebook, which was used to load and prepare data as well as to answer the above questions. The code was documented using Markdown cells. 

## Licensing

The complete datasets from the Developer Survey were made public by Stack Overflow and can be accessed [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) under the [Open Database License (ODbL)](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/). Inflation data was retrieved from The World Bank's [website](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/brief/inflation-database).
